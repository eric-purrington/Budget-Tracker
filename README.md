## Description

This application allows a user to track their budget. It is able to take in expenses and incomes even while offline. Most of the code was given; the db.js, manifest.webmanifest, service-worker.js, and a lot of styling were all newly written.

## Installation

To install necessary dependencies run the following command:
````
npm i
````


## Usage

This app is quite simple and therefore pretty user-friendly. Add the name of a transaction, the transactions amount, and click whether you'd like to add funds or subtract funds. If it doesn't automatically update due to being offline don't fret. As soon as you enter online status the app will update with any and all transactions you fed it.
